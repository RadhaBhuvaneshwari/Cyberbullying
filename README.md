# DETECTION OF CYBERBULLYING ON SOCIAL MEDIA USING MACHINE LEARNING

This project focuses on combating cyberbullying through the development of a detection system, particularly targeting hate speech on Twitter and personal attacks on Wikipedia. The methodology involves several key steps. First, data collection is performed from Kaggle, yielding a dataset of 16,858 records. Next, data preprocessing is conducted to clean the text data by removing special characters and cases. Subsequently, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are applied to vectorize the text data for machine learning model compatibility.

For model selection, two prominent algorithms are compared: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Logistic Regression, a supervised learning technique used for predicting categorical dependent variables, proves effective due to its simplicity and interpretability. On the other hand, Random Forest, an ensemble learning method, is preferred for its ability to handle large datasets with high dimensionality and prevent overfitting. The selection of the optimal model is based on cross-validation performance.

Throughout the project, tools such as Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) are utilized for NLP processing, while Python programming language serves as the primary environment for implementation. Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms are implemented using Python's scikit-learn library, leveraging its extensive functionalities for machine learning tasks.

In conclusion, the proposed architecture demonstrates promising results in detecting cyberbullying, particularly hate speech and personal attacks, with accuracies exceeding 90% using basic machine learning algorithms. By employing NLP techniques and robust machine learning models, this project offers a viable solution for mitigating the harmful effects of cyberbullying on social media platforms.
